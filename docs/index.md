## Project layout

This repository contains a pipeline for collecting, processing, and storing DNA and mRNA expression
profile data of given species from publicly available genetic databases.

### 1. Data Acquisition:

- Extract DNA data from Ensembl genomic database. Includes nucleotide sequences of gene components
  (promoter, 5'UTR, CDS, 3'UTR and terminator) for each protein-coding gene.
- Extract mRNA data from NCBI SRA. Gene expression data is obtained using nf-core/rnaseq processing workflow.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:

- Calculate required codon frequency, GC content, and sequence length features for genomic data.
- Calculate Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) and median expression, and filter genes with RSD < 2.
- Merge genomic and transcriptomic data tables by gene ID.
